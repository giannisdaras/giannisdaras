<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Giannis Daras </h1>
I am a first year Computer Science Ph.D. student at UT Austin. I am honored to be supervised by Prof. Alexandros Dimakis. I received my undergraduate degree in ECE from National Technical University of Athens (NTUA).

I am interested in the theory and the applications of Machine Learning. Recently, I have been publishing in attention networks and inverse problems for generative models.
